          Week 2 Questions!

       <br>

      <section>

       <p> <b> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b></p>

       <p>The liquid-like texture of the page.</p>

       <p><b>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</b></p>
       <ul>
       <li>I immediately went to click on the middle of the page, causing the page to skew to the middle.</li> 
       <li>I then spent a couple of seconds just moving my cursor around the screen in the shape of a figure 8.</li> 
       <li>I then touched the settings which caused the sound to actually kick in and be overwhelmingly loud.</li> 
       <li>I made the entropy bar go to the max and my mouse size smaller making the screen look like baking paper.</li> 
       <li>However when I moved my mouse the opposite area to where I clicked showed the original image, like a window through the chaos.</li> </p>
       </ul>
       <p><b>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b></p>

       <p>I spent more time interacting with the screen than messing with the settings which is interesting because my brain knew it would be more engaging if I changed settings and then played with the screen, but it just stuck with the settings and minimal changes during the period of the experience. </p>

       <p><b>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b></p>

       <p>Rapid movements of my mouse around the screen was absolutely the biggest and most common action. </p>

       <p><b>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b></p>

       <p>I think the primary goal of the experience is to have the user be enamoured by the unique visuals that they are creating and try to interact further with the site. Upon changing the settings the audio kicks in and begins to fit with the visuals creating a surreal experience of a real image being distorted into unreal and uncanny visuals which will hopefully stick with the audience. </p>

       <p><b>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b></p>

       <p>I think the experience communicates its goal well, having the instant change within the site once the mouse is moved making sure that the audience is engaged with the experiences from the second they are interacting with it. </p>

       <p><b>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b></p>

       <p>Around 5 minutes is around the time I think the experience should be interacted with each time. The replay-ability of the experience lends itself to more than a singular usage, but entirely depends on the users attention span and interest in abstractions so around 2-4 times in total as an average. </p>

       <p><b>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</b></p>

       <p>It communicates this multiple time usage through its use of the sliders that can change how the experience is used. With this level of difference being able to be found each time, it is more apparent that is intended to be used and visited multiple times by the same user or for a longer stretch in one usage. </p>

   <h2>
      Week 3 Questions!
   </h2>

   <br>

   <section>
   
       <p><b>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b></p>

       <p>The only other reference that the site itself even slightly references is that of video and video games. These visual spectacles of movement are most commonly found within the form of video, but the interactive nature of causing them is mostly confined to that of video games which is why the experience feels like a mesh of the two forms. </p>

       <p><b>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b></p>

       <p>The reference to the video game format tells me that the experience wishes for the audience to act in the same way in which they do when games are played. Moving and playing with the interactive elements to try and change what is on screen is a core part of the interactivity of both this expereience and games as a whole.</p>

       <p><b>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b></p>

       <p>Referencing the format of video helps us to understand the feelings that we are meant to be feeling because of the experience. Due to this experience having similar formatting to that of an interactable video, the feelings of initial confusion which turn into satisfaction due to your own actions within the experience are very similar to that of a video and remind me of many similar experiences.  </p>

       <p><b>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b></p>

       <p>The most frustrating element of the interaction to me is a minor one that will only effect a small amount of the people who interact with this experience, but is an annoyance nonetheless. It relates to my having multiple monitors, when I alt/tab to another window on my opposite monitor, it drags all of the liquid to the right of the screen ruining what I had created which, while minor, is something that did take me out of the experience.</p>

       <p><b>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b></p>

       <p>The most satisfying element of the interaction is by far the usage of the website itself. The feeling of being able to control exactly what liquid-like effects are happening and knowing that each movement is combining to create unique imagery is a very satisfying and neccesary part of the experience to work.</p>
