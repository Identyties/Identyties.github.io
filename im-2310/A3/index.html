          <div class="Final">This webpage was designed with the abstract adjective Translucent and the interaction design principle of Agency in mind. These words were only unlocked once the correct order of the colours was chosen. The original idea for the website was to be a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku, having the user find and click the incorrect answers to make the rest of that colour translucent, and have the text partially revealed until all were completed, leaving the text available to read. The idea of having the text be there on the page from the start, but not readable unless you interacted and engaged with the website was the core idea of the pages design. The text was both physically obscured and slightly readable by the translucent squares and also translucent in the metaphoric sense, being on the page from when its first loaded and technically accessible, but not immediately, meaning its slightly obscured and translucent in the way it is giving information rather than transparent Ie straight up giving you the information. Utilizing the grid formation was another core part of the idea and a large part of the interactive nature of the page. This lead me to consider adding the use of random generation to create a webpage that was more engaging and replayable. However due to time constraints and my own ability to create or replicate such a code both the random generation and finding the incorrect answers aspects of the project were scrapped. This lead my idea to continue but with less of the aspects of sudoku factoring in, just the grid shape being the only factor that continued through the redesign. The correct way to answer and interact with the puzzle and subsequently access this information is to click one of the 4 yellow squares, then one of the whites, purples and finally blacks before it reveals it all. The order of what should be clicked in what order is based off of the order of the Non-Binary pride flag. This interaction is not obvious and the resetting of the page on wrong answer makes it more annoying for the user than it should be. This however was another idea that had to be cut due to time constraints, but if I had more time then would absolutely be the primary idea used. What is actually on the page is when any of the 4 colours are chosen, it reveals all of them as translucent, the opacity being just enough for the text behind to be legible. The neutral colour scheme of the background opposing the jarring pride colors give the website a design that is unique and interesting. The colours are more apparent on the interactable elements which mean the interaction is more heavily implied. Overall while the project is not what I originally intended for the website, this iteration still uses the theory of interaction design that I initially created and implements it well. </div>
